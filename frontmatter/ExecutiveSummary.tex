\chapter*{Executive Summary}
\begin{SingleSpace}
\initial{T}he overarching objective of this project was to develop a TEL solution towards the primary benefit of the University of Bristol's Computer Science conversion course, by mitigating the shortcomings of a traditional instructor lead and class room based pedagogy. These aforementioned shortcomings may include but are not limited to scheduling clashes, teaching resource allocation inefficiencies and compromised learning as well as teaching objectives.

Therefore the solution proposed and developed is Artemis, a social network that will enable flexible learning via a blended pedagogy strategy. Artemis is to be disseminated as an Open Source program under the \hl{XXXXXX} license, as an Open Educational Resource.


The project involved 80\% implementation and 20\% research. Therefore the report begins by explaining the shortcomings of a traditional pedagogy and justifying the rationale for modern pedagogies and learning methods that incorporate technology. Using this as a foundation it goes on to explore the various possible modalities for deploying a TEL solution and justifying the rationale for selecting the development of a social network. Apart from enabling a modern pedagogy possible use cases and modalities to enable participatory learning models from the fiel of neural networks, crowd sourcing knoledge, Virtual learning environments
